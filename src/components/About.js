      <p>
        Hello! My name is Violet Katrin. For the past six months I have immersed myself in Learning
        React, Node JS, Javascript and related frameworks. I have recently graduated from Alchemy, a
        coding bootcamp located in Portland Oregon. I am a curious and empathetic person who is
        looking to find her role in a diverse team of creative individuals. I also hope to foster
        relationships that allow me to mentor other LGBTQ+ individuals on their journey breaking
        into a field in software development. I am happiest when I am learning something new. In my
        free time I love hiking and camping around the pacific northwest, 35mm film photography, and
        juggling!
